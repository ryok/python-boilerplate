# Knowledge Management System

## Claude AI Integration
The project uses a structured knowledge management system in the `.claude/` directory:

### File Structure
- **`.claude/context.md`**
  - Project background and purpose
  - Technology stack selection rationale
  - Business requirements and technical constraints

- **`.claude/project-knowledge.md`**
  - Implementation patterns and design decisions
  - Architecture choices and reasoning
  - Anti-patterns to avoid

- **`.claude/project-improvements.md`**
  - Past trial and error records
  - Failed implementations and their causes
  - Improvement processes and results

- **`.claude/common-patterns.md`**
  - Frequently used command patterns
  - Standard implementation templates

### Update Rules
- Document new implementations in relevant files
- Record important decisions with context
- Keep knowledge files up-to-date
- Include both successes and failures
- Provide reasoning for architectural choices

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Date significant changes
- Link related decisions
- Maintain consistent formatting
